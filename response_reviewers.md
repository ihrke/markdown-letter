We would like to extend our thanks and appreciation for your consideration of our manuscript entitled *blubb*. We are thankful for the excellent reviews which raised a number of very good points. We have made significant changes to our manuscript for this new revision and we believe that it has considerably improved it.

First of all, blubber

After implementing these changes, we believe that our manuscript has improved substantially and that it will provide compelling evidence for or against tDCS effects on mind-wandering. We therefore hope that you will find our new revision adequate for publication in the European Journal of Neuroscience.
